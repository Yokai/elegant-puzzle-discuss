=========

Welcome!  This is a book club and discussion group for ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/), by [Will Larson](https://twitter.com/lethain), in summer 2019.  It is also an experiment in pop-up community, and possibly kind of an art project?  I've wanted to try something like this for a while..  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this group is to book study ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) discuss any questions, contradictions, or challenges that came up for us while doing so, with a group of our peers.  Discussion is not limited to textual analysis from the text; we may discuss problems or questions on engineering leadership or management, including stories from our own lives. 

This is not a permanent community.  There are plenty of those already.  The group is a temporary participatory space that will disperse once we are done reading and discussing the book.  My hope is that this may add urgency, focus, and commitment to our discussion.

## Book club

Starting Sunday, June 16th, we will cover one chapter per week, rolling on to the next each following Sunday.

A moderator will kick off an open thread each Sunday with some thoughts on the new chapter.  Please start new threads (or fork existing threads) at will.  All topics we've already covered fare fair game, but try not to drift into upcoming chapter topics.
