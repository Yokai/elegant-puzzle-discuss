=========

Welcome!  This is a book club and discussion group for "An Elegant Puzzle", by Will Larson, in summer 2019.  It is also an experiment in pop-up community, and possibly a pretentious sort of art project.


Purpose
-------

The members of this group want to read through "An Elegant Puzzle" together with other people facing similar challenges to their own.  Discussion will not be limited topics from the text, it may include any problems or questions on engineering leadership or management, including personal situations.

This is not a permanent community.  There are plenty of those already.  The group is a temporary participatory space that will disperse once we are done reading and discussing the book.  I hope that this will add urgency, focus, and commitment to our discussion.

Will Larson was not harmed in the making of this group.  (Yes, he does plan to subscribe and participate, but is not to be held responsible for any messes that result.)

Rules and Guidelines
---------

I hope we all know how to be good citizens, and the moderators will have nothing to do.  But if we need to, we will privately nudge people, issue warnings, or unsubscribe people for counterproductive behavior or CoC violations.

**Moderator list: tbd**

* Who can join?  Anyone who fits the bill (below).
* You must read the Code of Conduct and this README before you join.
* To join, send an introductory email to elegant-puzzle-discuss@googlegroups.com. 
* We will cap the subscriber list at something reasonable (30? 50?) so everyone can participate and it's not too overwhelming.
* Please do not publicly promote the existence of this list to any mass audiences.
* Please do invite people who will have wise and/or interesting things to say, via word of mouth or personal invite.
* At some point we will cap signups, so don't delay.  :)

If you have a problem, please contact a moderator.


Who can join?
----------

This group is for:

* Engineers and technical practitioners in relatively senior roles (7+ years?)
* Managers of engineering or other technical teams
* Leaders, founders, and executives of technical organizations
* Readers of the book "An Elegant Puzzle", either at book club pace or previously
* People who want to participate

Not:

* recruiters, lurkers, mystery folks with no intro, people who are into the subject matter but won't read the book, assholes



Calendar
--------

Starting Sunday, June 16th, and rolling over on each following Sunday, we will cover one chapter per week until the book is done.  

You can start talking about this week's chapter as soon as it's Sunday where you are.  Charity (or another moderator) will kick off an open thread on Sunday with some thoughts on chapter, but please feel free to start new threads or branch existing threads at will.  

Please do your best NOT to stray into topics not yet covered; if we are on chapter "Culture" this week, any earlier material is fair game to discuss but you may not refer to stuff in the "Careers" chapter.  The moderators will gently and indulgently help you stay on track if you haven't read ahead, but if you *have* read ahead, do be careful.
