elegant-puzzle-discuss
=========

Welcome!  elegant-puzzle-discuss is a book club and discussion group devoted to "An Elegant Puzzle", by Will Larson.  It is also an experiment in temporary community, and possibly an extremely pretentious psychological art project.


Purpose
-------

This group is for people who want to talk about "An Elegant Puzzle" with other smart people who are going through similar experiences, as well as any related matters of engineering leadership or management, regardless of how closely or distantly related to the source material it may be.

I want this book to have an enduring impact on this and the next generation of technical leaders, and want to do my part to spread and interrogate its content. 


This is not a permanent community.  We have plenty of those already.  The group is a temporary participatory space spun up to communally process a dense relevant text over the summer of 2019, and then we will disperse again.  Think book club meets EC2 spot instances.  My theory is that a time bounded container may enrich the caliber of discourse by adding urgency and focus.

I plan to leave the archives up after postings have been disabled, but will ask the group for consent before doing so.

This group was created with the consent and some participation of Will Larson (but he is not responsible for any messes which may result)


Rules and Guidelines
---------

* There will be a list of moderators, made public in this space.
* Anyone who meets these criteria and wants to participate is welcome to join.
* To join the group, first read the rest of this README and our Code of Conduct.  If you do not agree to the terms, please do not join this list.
* If you agree to these terms, send an introductory email about yourself to elegant-puzzle-discuss@googlegroups.com.  Tell the group who you are, what you do, what you are hoping to learn or get out of this book club slash temporary art installation.
* We want everyone who joins to actively participate, so we will cap the subscriber list at something reasonable (30? 50?)
* I may tweet about it once, to fish outside my immediate pond, but other than that, please do not *publicly promote* the existence of this list to any mass audiences.  We would like to gather interested people primarily by word of mouth and personal recommendations, not impersonal blasts.
* You are encouraged to pass this README along to any thoughtful technical leaders, managers or engineers who you think would be excellent contributors to this dialogue.
* At some point we will turn off signups, so don't delay.

Hopefully we all know how to be good citizens of a mailing list community, and the moderators will have nothing to do.  But if we need to, we will privately nudge people, issue warnings, or unsubscribe people for counterproductive behavior or CoC violations.

If you have a problem, please contact any of the moderators for help.


Who can join?
----------

This group is for:

* Engineers and technical practitioners in relatively senior roles (7+ years?)
* Managers of engineering or other technical teams
* Leaders, founders, and executives of technical organizations
* Readers of the book "An Elegant Puzzle", either at book club pace or previously
* People who want to participate

Not:

* recruiters, lurkers, mystery folks with no intro, people who are into the subject matter but won't read the book, assholes



Calendar
--------

Starting Sunday, June 16th, and rolling over on each following Sunday, we will cover one chapter per week until the book is done.  

You can start talking about this week's chapter as soon as it's Sunday where you are.  Charity (or another moderator) will kick off an open thread on Sunday with some thoughts on chapter, but please feel free to start new threads or branch existing threads at will.  

Please do your best NOT to stray into topics not yet covered; if we are on chapter "Culture" this week, any earlier material is fair game to discuss but you may not refer to stuff in the "Careers" chapter.  The moderators will gently and indulgently help you stay on track if you haven't read ahead, but if you *have* read ahead, do be careful.
