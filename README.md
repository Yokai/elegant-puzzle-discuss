=========

Welcome!  This is a book club and discussion group for ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/), by [Will Larson](https://twitter.com/lethain), in summer 2019.  It is also an experiment in pop-up community, and possibly kind of an art project?  I've wanted to try something like this for a while..  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this group is to book study ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) discuss any questions, contradictions, or challenges that came up for us while doing so, with a group of our peers.  Discussion need not be strictly limited to the text; personal stories or anecdotes or questions about engineering leadership or management are fair game.

This is not a permanent community.  There are plenty of those already.  The group is a **temporary participatory space** that will disperse once we are done reading and discussing the book, around the first week of August.

## Book club

Starting Sunday, June 16th, we will cover one chapter per week.  Every Sunday, I or another moderator will kick off an open thread with some thoughts on the next chapter.  

But please start new threads (or fork existing threads) at will.  All topics we've already covered fare fair game, but try not to drift into upcoming chapter topics.
